\documentclass[12pt, conference]{IEEEtran}
\usepackage[sc]{mathpazo}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\graphicspath{ {assets/} }
\usepackage{amsmath}
% Some Computer Society conferences also require the compsoc mode option,
% but others use the standard conference format.
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[conference]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\section{Introduction}
% no \IEEEPARstart

Narrative is the primal way many forms of media convey a message to its audience and video games are no different. Although an argument can be made regarding the ludological aspects of games and how narrative is not always a must-have within video games \cite{murray}, it certainly is a powerful tool video games have at their disposal to speak to the audience. However, more so that often, delivering a compelling narrative is not as straightforward as dumping exposition at the audience in hopes that they will believe that story. The medium must put care into making the story believable through every mode of interaction the media offers. Fallout 4, although rough on the edges in some parts of its narrative, nails down what many video games fail to execute upon: narrative through procedurality. Fallout 4 is able to deliver an immersive experience using the rules and mechanics of the video game to deliver a narrative of what it would feel like to live in a post-apocalyptic world where the socioeconomic and political landscape is in tatters and the mode of living is very foreign to many of us. In the rest of this paper, we will discuss how and why delivering a compelling narrative through procedurality is difficult and see how Fallout 4's execution shines in this area to deliver a very compelling story.\\

\section{Delivering a Narrative}

To understand how and why video games struggle in delivering narrative through procedurality \cite{harper}, we shall first illustrate what must be done to deliver a compelling narrative in general. Delivering a compelling narrative can be a very difficult task often requiring mastery of the art to execute well upon. This is especially true in film as often the quality of the narrative and how it's delivered to the audience is a prime marker for judgement. In particular, delivering a narrative through pure exposition with two people talking to each other is mostly frowned upon as this type of story telling does not make the audience think and reflect upon; the audience is lead to take in whatever that is being said. This type of story telling gives little room for the audience to attempt to believe the situation and if the film does not back this exposition in any other form, be it using visual or audio cues, the audience no longer has an incentive to believe what they have been told. Even more so, if the film fails to keep its exposition and visuals consistent, the audience immediately breaks away from the illusion of being immersed within the narrative. These observations are summed up very well in a video essay by Tony Zhou \cite{everyframeapainting}.\\

This difficulty of keeping the narrative across different channels in the medium becomes even more complex in the context of video games. Video games, being fundamentally an interactive medium, have the capability of pulling the audience closer and more initimate with the narrative than other forms of media. As a caveat, they also run the risk of breaking the experience due to poor coordination of all the parts that make up a video game ruining the experience of playing the video game as a whole. Among the parts video games use to deliver a narrative, by far the one that has the strongest effects on the video game experience would be the procedurality the game offers: the set of rules and mechanics that define the domain of actions that govern the gameplay of the particular video game.\\

\section{Fallout 4}

Fallout 4, is a the fifth installment in the Fallout franchise along with Fallouts 1-3 and Fallout: New Vegas. The Fallout universe is set in an alternate world where the cold war never ended and humanity ended up going into a global nuclear war in the late 21st century. In this post apocalyptic world, the nuclear fallout over the entire world has halted technological advancements of the pre-war age as well as set a completely different socioeconomic and political terrain for the survivors of the new world. There are a number of key differences in this new world that drive the narrative of this drastic change in how people live their lives \cite{lovelifeandanarchy}.\\

\begin{itemize}
    \item For the majority of people, technological advancements have halted leading to the industrialized production of goods to become practically non-existent.
    \item Much of the ruins that the nuclear bombs caused are still as they were, untouched. As there are a lot of recyclable resources within these ruins, resource collection has essentially become a scavenge hunt as mining for fresh minerals to produce complex pre-war resources is either impossible or more wasteful than scavenging for materials.
    \item Most resources from the pre-war age have been contaminated with nuclear radiation.
    \item Most governments have collapsed, rendering government control of currency to stop functioning. People use bottle-caps as money since all pre-war factories that produced bottle-caps have broken down making bottlecaps a scarce resource suitable to use as currency.
    \item Due to lack of industrialized production, travelling traders have become ubiquitous.
    \item The human population has become minuscule compared to the pre-war age meaning that there are a lot more resources per capita that resource wars are no longer an issue.
\end{itemize}

With such a rich prelude of promises for a story in this new world, Fallout 4 sends us to live amidst the wreckage of the city of Commonwell, to co-inhabit this city rich with different people and factions. With this setting, the game further reinforces the narrative it attempts to deliver through its own rules and mechanics.\\

\subsection{The rules of the world}

One of the game's core mechanics is how the player heals their health in-game. Healing can be done through consumption of most edible items in-game ranging from roach meat to conserved food from the pre-war age. However, the player will notice that every time they consume such items, they get radiation poisoning which effectively decreases their maximum health. One way to avoid this radiation poisoning is to cook some of the resources before consuming it. This in-game mechanic delivers a narrative to remind the player of the state of the world by forcing us to do mundane activities like cooking in order to survive.\\

On a much larger context, the game offers a crafting mechanic which allows the player to craft many things such as new structures for our settlements, new equipment like guns and armor. Crafting any of these requires different in-game resources like wool, wood, steel etc. Unlike many games with a crafting system, however, the player does not mine for the exact material or a non-processed version of the material like metal ore or something alike. Instead, most primary resources can only be found from processed materials such as food cans and plastic containers for aluminium and plastic respectively. This mechanic gives the player the sense of the post apocalyptic world we described in the beginning of the section where the player is truly attempting to scavenge resources for survival, digging through the remains of the pre-war age whilst defending against raiders that attempt to loot their corpse after killing it.\\

Of course the game does not make the entire crafting system into a scavenge hunt for that one tire to turn into rubber to modify a gun. If the player is willing to spend the bottle-caps (the currency), they could simply buy it from the right trader. That said, the scarcity of bottle-caps the player experiences would also be another point of discussion which ties into the narrative very well. As the player progresses into increasingly harder sections of the game, the player spends increasingly larger amounts of increasingly more expensive ammo which they would need to buy using the bottle-caps they collected on their progression through the game. This leads the player to have to do menial tasks on their side to earn the money that would get them through the interesting parts of the game. This mentality of doing menial tasks to earn the money to enjoy their time makes for very intriguing commentary on the capitalist world \cite{bogost}.\\

\subsection{Narrative as an experience}

In all the situations described above, the player is presented a reasonable set of actions they may do, often even being forced to do so due to in-game necessity. This effect of game mechanics enforcing the player for a specific behaviour seamlessly helps the player to be further immersed in the narrative of the world.\\

But the game doesn't just stop at simply immersing the player in the narrative. By carefully designing around what kind of lifestyle the player is encouraged to lead in-game, the game lets the players \emph{experience} how life in this type of world would feel like should they be in their character's situation, evoking a sense of agency through merely the illusion of choice \cite{hogle}. Better yet, we are even able to draw parallels to the fact that actual people in some third world countries lead their lives scavenging for resources in the slums in struggle to make a living similar to people in the Fallout universe. By simply providing the player the possibilities and necessities of living in the Fallout universe, the player is given the freedom to have their own unique experiences in the world.\\

\section{Conclusion}

Video games have the unique privilege to utilize procedurality to make the player's experience richer and more immersive and reach out to them in a much more personal level than most other forms of media can. Designing with rules and mechanics that fit the narrative of a video game is not an easy to goal to accomplish and Fallout 4 is no exception \cite{anderson}. There are major and minor issues with the game in other aspects not mentioned in this paper. Yet, the Fallout franchise, across multiple installments succeeds in delivering the core narrative that is the \emph{experience} of living in a post apocalyptic world.\\

% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.

% Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure

% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or
